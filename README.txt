To generate the figures and the table results in the paper, run "CorrentropyFilter.m"

This archive includes the following files.

- The given dynamic model of the navigation problem is simulated in "sysinfo.m"    
- The shot noise is generated in "Shot_Noise.m"
- The Gaussian mixture noise is generated in "Mix_Noise.m"
- The unscented Kalman filter is desigend in "ukf.m"
- Matlab plot options are set in "SetPlotOptions.m"
